In the following experiment it will be your task to catch coins,
flying from the middle of the screen.

You will move your bucket around on the big outer circle, 
using the turning wheel. Before each new coin, you can choose 
a new location for your bucket. Basically, you need to anticipate 
where the next coin will land.

Usually the coins will fly at approximately the same location. But sometimes
this location will change!
